Hi r/sysadmin (https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin), amp#x200B; Each week I thought I'd post these SysAdmin tools, tips, tutorials etc. Here are the most-interesting items that have come across our desks, laptops and phones this week.

So, every now and then I see that someone mentions the word „Loop“ on this subreddit. However, this happens in the comment section of other threads most of the time and it’s hard to explain these systems in a few comments. I’ve noticed that most diabetics here on Reddit don’t know about so-called “DIY Closed Loop Systems” and that’s why I created this thread: To spread awareness about these systems and how you can take advantage of them. amp#x200B; Do I need to be tech-savvy Во-первых, вы пытаетесь открыть Android-файл программой для iPhone.

First chapter (https://www.reddit.com/r/ereader/comments/86i0yh/my_journey_on_finding_a_good_ereader_and_a_review/) About a year ago, I went through a pretty extensive search for a good e-reader, and for a while, I had found that. Recently, though I discovered another "type" of e-reader that I think everyone should reconsider, as I feel its by far and away the superior one. I am referring to android e-ink tablets. In my case, I acquired a BOOX Nova Pro 7.8, but almost all of this will apply.

Hey, new to Android and rooting. I successfully rooted my 5T using TWRP and Magisk but after a while decided to go back to stock. I followed instructions to copy an official package from oneplus website and flash (I hope that's the right term) from TWRP. I wiped beforehand as per the instructions. I've obviously messed up because I've got a 'zip treble compatibility error' and 'No OS installed are you sure you wish to reboot'. When I reboot I have a black screen and white EDIT: I mean Keepass DX Using Keepass DX from Fdroid repo. My database file is kept on my nextcloud server. I have the nextcloud app on my phone. Since Keepass DX doesn't have a webdav support, I have to navigate to the file via android file explorer. This works, but when I close the app and reopen it, it has a pop up error saying: gtcould not find file. Try reopening it from your file browser. Even though I have it set to remember the database file and set as default. How do I resolve. I am a PC guy. Or at least, that's what I want to keep telling myself. uTorrent being my client of choice since I want to say 2006, but I've been through 4 computers since then so I can't be for sure. Now though, my very nice PC that I built back in 2015 is on the fritz. I believe it to be the power supply, but I have a one month old on top of 3 other kids and a new job. I have neither the time nor realistically the budget to troubleshoot and fix my PC currently. So I've explored alternatives. This dramatically increased my battery life, so I though I'll share it with the community. Just follow each step carefully. 1. Download Tasker from the Play Store.

All well. I spent the last few days installing various apps, cleaning bloatware, changing themes, and so forth. Today I installed ES File Explorer, because I heard it was very good. After a while I was playing around with it the app crashed, slowing down my phone until I finally managed to access it. I thought to myself "nope", and uninstalled the app. After that tho, many more apps were giving me "the app has crashed" message straight after I opened them. Tried clear. Previously i was using ES file explorer on my android phone to send files like movies/shows to my firestick. But now the ES explorer app has been removed from google play store. How do i transfer the files now?? Even a windows solution I'm trying to get Kodi (latest) working with DAVS on my Android v8.1 phone but I'm having some troubles  amp#x200B; Basically I have this setup. Kodi on Android \~ Internet \~ Home Router \~ NAS (Synology) amp#x200B; Normal DAV seems to be working fine and when I use ES File Explorer on Android, I can also see the files using DAVS, I'm guessing ES File Explorer is less strict than Kodi and doesn't validate the certificate? amp#x200B; I've tried exporting the Synology certificat. Hey All, amp#x200B; In response to /u/DotcomL's post (https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/b3p3u7/nano_ux_and_universal_links_in_a_decentralized/) concerning Universal Links, I spent the weekend creating a new feature for nanotipbot.com (https://nanotipbot.com). This is a Payment Intent link generator, that will generate a deep link and try to open an application on your phone or computer with the payment information already pre-filled out. If it is unsuccessful, it redirects.

Edit: Responding to a few people, but the general theme of those responses will be asking what their thoughts on their used vs new options were when they looked. And why they chose one or the other.
